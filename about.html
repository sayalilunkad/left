  <p>I am interested in open-source software and eager to contribute back where I can and
  occasionally help people to get involved and contribute to open-source projects.
  I have completed my graduation in computer science and currently am a volunteer contributor for OpenStack projects.

  I also take interest in scuba diving and am working towards becoming a licensed scuba diver!
  In my free time I enjoy salsa dancing and painting ocassionally.
