I was invited to give a talk at the [Pune GNUnify OpenStack meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Indian-OpenStack-User-Group/events/162277702/). Here I needed to talk about my experience in FOSS and about my internship with OpenStack. You can find the presentation [here](http://sayalilunkad.github.io/talks/OpenStack/OPW.html#/step-1). It was an amazing experience. Being my first public talk I was a bit nervous initially but then it went well. After the talk too I had many people coming up to me especially women who were motivated to participate in the program and get more involved with OpenStack. I met some people who are heavily involved in OpenStack in one way or the other, [Sajid Akhtar](), [Kavit Munshi](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/kavit-munshi/24/745/438), [Pranav Salunke](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pranav-salunke/32/437/536) and [Rohan Kanade](http://www.linkedin.com/in/kanade). We had some good discussions about encouraging more students to work with OpenStack by conducting workshops and hackathons where everyone could meet and work together. It ended with a fine dinner. Hope to keep interacting with more members of the community soon!
