<p>I am extremely honoured and elated to be selected as one of the 3 participants for the Outreach Program for Women organized by the GNOME Foundation. I will be working on a OpenStack project for OPW.
Thanks to all the very supportive community members of OpenStack, especially my mentor Ladislav Smola, I have had a very smooth experience and have been greatly motivated to take up more challenges.
I look forward to an exciting internship period in the next few months!</p>
